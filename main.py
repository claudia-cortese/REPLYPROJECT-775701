"""# Exploratory Data Analysis

We start our Explanatory Data Analysis by inspecting the image properties. This is particularly important as they can significantly impact the models' performance and the preprocessing steps to undertake.

These are the **Key Image Properties** to consider:
1. **Width and Height**: the dimensions of the images can affect the input layer of your neural network. Uniform image sizes are typically required for most deep learning models. Large variations in size may necessitate resizing, which could affect the quality or aspect ratio of your images.

2. **Mode**: it refers to the type and depth of pixel information contained in the image. It indicates how the pixel values are structured, representing the color system and the number of bits used for each component. The mode affects how the image data is processed and analyzed.

3. **File Size**: Larger images, in terms of file size, can significantly increase the computational resources required for training. They might also indicate higher resolution or more complex images. An option could be to compress or downsample the images to reduce file sizes if large images don't offer a clear advantage for the classification goals.

4. **Image Contrast and Brightness**: Variations in contrast and brightness across the dataset can affect model performance by obscuring features or creating inconsistent input data. Brightness is typically defined as the average pixel value of an image. For a grayscale image, this can be computed by averaging the pixel values. On the other hand, contrast measures the difference in luminance or color that makes an object distinguishable. For a grayscale image, a common measure of contrast is the standard deviation of the pixel values.

5. **Texture and Pattern**: The presence of unique textures or patterns within the images can be crucial for classification. These features might help in distinguishing between different classes. Feature extraction methods can help in capturing these nuances but we will see this later on during the Preprocessing step.

6. **Image Noise Level**: Image noise is defined as a random variation of brightness or color information in images and is usually an aspect of electronic noise as, for example, it can be produced by the image sensor and circuitry of a scanner. Images with high levels of noise may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns so an usual practice would be implementing noise reduction techniques. Our dataset is composed of images of scanned documents, clearly suggesting the presence of image noise. However, because of the size of the dataset, it was too computationally expensive to properly address this issue.

Iterating through the images to inspect their properties and appending them to the list called *image_properties*. For an easier manipulation and analysis of the data we are converting the *image_properties* list into a pandas DataFrame and displaying the first entries. Lastly we are going to print the DataFrame head to have a quick overview of the properties of the first 5 images.

*Takes around 5 min to run (Google Colab Approximation)*

  file_path = os.path.join(image_dir, file_name)
  with Image.open(file_path) as img:
    contrast = np.std(img) # Calculating contrast using pixel standard deviation
    brightness = np.mean(img) #Calculating brightness using average pixel value

    image_properties.append({
        'FileName': file_name,

"""We are going to inspect these properties further by plotting:

1. Distribution of Image Widths
2. Image Contrast Distribution
3. Image Brightness Distribution

Moreover, we are going to make sure that all our images are in grayscale mode (L). When images are in grayscale mode, each pixel is represented by a single value from 0 (black) to 255 (white), indicating the intensity of light.

Mode L simplifies the preprocessing steps in several ways, particularly since we are preparing the images for classification tasks.

1. Reduced Dimensionality: grayscale images have a single channel, reducing the complexity and computational requirements for processing compared to color images, which typically have three channels (RGB). This means operations like filtering, normalization, and feature extraction can be faster and require less memory.

2. Simplified Feature Extraction: features in grayscale images relate to intensity and texture rather than color. This simplifies the types of features you might look for during feature extraction, focusing on edges, contrast, and patterns in light intensity.

3. Normalization: normalization typically involves scaling pixel values to a range that is more suitable for the algorithms you're using, often [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. For grayscale images this process is straightforward dividing pixels by 255.0.

1. Image Dimensions (Width and Height):

  Plot a box plot provides a clear visual summary of the distribution of widths, highlighting the median, quartiles, and any outliers.

  Insights: identifying whether there are many images that deviate significantly from the common widths (outliers), which could affect your preprocessing strategy or model performance.

2. Contrast and Brightness:

  Plot histograms or density plots of contrast and brightness to see their distributions across your dataset.

  Insights: Identifying variations can guide you to apply normalization or adjustment techniques to make the dataset more uniform.

"""# Preprocessing

**Local Binary Patterns** **(LBP)** is a powerful feature extraction technique for texture classification and is particularly useful for image classification tasks. It captures the local texture information of an image, which can be very effective for distinguishing different types of scanned documents, such as resumes in our case. Moreover, LBP is computationally efficient and simple to implement, making it suitable for large datasets like ours.

When setting up LBP, these are the parameters to take into consideration:

1. **Radius:** the radius defines the distance from the center pixel to the surrounding pixels used for comparison. The radius determines the scale at which texture features are captured. A smaller radius focuses on fine, local textures, while a larger radius captures broader texture patterns. A radius of 1 is considered sufficient for capturing local texture patterns without losing too much spatial detail.

2. **Number of Points:** the number of points refers to the number of sample points on the circumference of the circle (with the defined radius) used for comparison with the center pixel. The number of points affects the resolution of the texture description. More points provide a more detailed texture representation but also increase computational complexity. Typically set as a multiple of the radius, ensuring that the points are evenly distributed around the circle. For a radius of 1, 8 points (one for each direction: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) is a standard choice.

3. **Method:** the method specifies the LBP variant used to compute the patterns. Common methods include 'default', 'ror', 'uniform', 'var'. The choice of method affects the robustness and invariance of the LBP features. The 'uniform' method reduces the number of patterns and improves robustness against noise. Moreover, it reduces the feature vector size and improves discrimination while maintaining rotational invariance.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA achieves this by identifying the principal components, which are the directions in the data that maximize variance. These components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first principal component captures the most variance, the second captures the next most, and so on.

In our code, we set n_components=2 to reduce the features to two dimensions for visualization. When using PCA for other purposes, one might select the number of components based on the amount of variance they want to retain.

The aim of the preprocessing step is to properly prepare our data, in our case scanned documents, for modelling.

**Preprocessing Steps:**

1. **Resizing:** as a first step, we decided to resize all of our images to a width and height of 750x1000. This is because during the EDA we observed that most images report an average width of 750 and a fixed height of 1000.
Setting a fixed target size for all images is important for model consistency as most models require a fixed target size as input.

2. **Images to Numpy Array:** converting images to NumPy Arrays is an essential step as machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn require image data to be in NumPy array format. Moreover, NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical computations, making operations on image data faster and more efficient compared to other data structures.

3. **Pixel Normalization:** as the original range of pixel values in an 8-bit grayscale image is [0, 255] and the desired range after normalization is [0, 1], dividing by 255.0 correctly normalized the image pixels.

4. **LBP Extraction:** in order to analyze the texture patterns of our images, we decided to extract the so called Local Binary Patterns. This method is able to capture the local texture information of an image, which can be very effective for distinguishing different types of scanned documents such in our case. We'll go more in detail in the next text box.

5. **Saving Properties and Features:** for an easier manipulation of the data, we save the properties of the preprocessed images into a pandas DataFrame, as we also did during our EDA. Moreover, we append the LBP features to a list called _features_ and standardize them using a standard scaler so that each feature contributes equally to the future analysis. In this way many machine learning algorithms, including K-Means and PCA (Principal Component Analysis), will perform better with standardized data.

6. **Dataset Splitting:** we split the dataset into training and test sets with a respective ratio of 80/20.

7. **PCA Analysis:** after extracting and standardizing LBP features, the PCA model is fitted on the training and test features and the principal components are computed. PCA reduces the number of features while retaining the most important information. This is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, like LBP features, which can be noisy and redundant. The transformed PCA features (both training and test) are plotted for visualization. This step helps in understanding the distribution and separability of the data in the reduced-dimensional space.

8. **Setting an Output Directory:** we save the processed images in an output directory on Google Drive so that it can be easily accessed in the future. On top of the processed images, we are also saving the test and train features obtained with LBP as well as the ones obtained with PCA for later use.

"""This graph represents a 2D visualization of the LBP features after being transformed by PCA. The blue points represent the training data, and the orange points represent the test data.

Here are some observations and insights based on the graph:

1. **Data Distribution and Overlap:** the training and test data points are largely overlapping, indicating that the training and test sets have a similar distribution. This is a good sign as it suggests that the split between the training and test sets was done properly and the models will have a similar data distribution during training and evaluation.

2. **Clusters and Separation:** There are no clearly distinct clusters visible in this PCA plot. This might imply that the LBP features, when reduced to two dimensions, do not show obvious separations between different classes. This lack of clear separation could be due to the intrinsic nature of the data or because two components are not enough to capture the variance needed to separate the classes clearly. To determine if the data can be better separated a strategy would be to consider more than two components or other dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE (we will see this later during the modelling).

3. **Outliers**: There are some outliers, especially on the right side of the plot. These outliers could represent images with unique textures or anomalies that are not well represented by the majority of the data.

### K-Means

A common practice in K-Means is implementsing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). This is done by plotting the sum of squared distances (SSD) between data points and their nearest cluster center for different values of K.

By comparing the Silhouette Scores of the two approaches, we can determine the effectiveness of PCA in improving clustering performance. Additionally, the cluster labels are prepared for further use in classification tasks, setting the stage for building and evaluating supervised learning models.

The Silhouette Score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where:

1. A score close to 1 indicates that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters and close to the cluster it is assigned to.
2. A score close to 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.
3. A score close to -1 indicates that the sample might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.


Silhouette Score for K-Means on LBP features: 0.3691

This score indicates moderate clustering quality. The LBP features are able to form reasonably distinct clusters, but there might be some overlap or ambiguity between clusters.

Silhouette Score for K-Means on PCA features: 0.4477

This score is higher than the LBP features score, indicating that the PCA features result in better-defined clusters. The clusters formed using PCA-transformed features are more distinct compared to those formed using raw LBP features.


The higher Silhouette Score for the PCA features suggests that applying PCA before clustering has improved the cluster separation. PCA helps by reducing dimensionality and potentially removing noise, thus leading to clearer and more distinct cluster boundaries.

"""The silhouette score is a useful metric for evaluating the quality of clustering, but it is not the only criterion to consider. The score measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, but it might not capture all the nuances of your specific data and clustering needs.

For this reason, we are going to apply t-SNE to both LPB and PCA features. t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction method specifically designed for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. t-SNE reduces the dimensionality of data to two or three dimensions, making it easier to visualize on a 2D or 3D plot.

So far our aim is to classify images into distinct clusters based on their texture features extracted using LBP and further reduced using PCA. To understand the effectiveness of our clustering and to gain insights into the structure of our data, we apply t-SNE to both the original LBP features and the PCA-transformed features. This helps in visualizing how well the clustering algorithm has performed and if the clusters are distinct and well-separated.

The provided t-SNE plots for LBP features and PCA features give us a visual representation of how well the data points are clustered.

**t-SNE on LBP Features:**

1. Distinct Clusters: The plot shows distinct clusters with different colors representing different cluster labels. The clusters are reasonably well-separated, indicating that the LBP features are capturing significant differences in the data that the clustering algorithm can use.

2. Cluster Shapes: The clusters vary in shape and density. Some clusters are more compact, while others are more spread out. This variation can provide insights into the underlying structure of the data.


**t-SNE on PCA Features:**

1. Distinct Clusters: Similar to the LBP features, the PCA-transformed features also show distinct clusters. The clusters are generally well-separated, though the separation might be less pronounced compared to the LBP features.

2. Cluster Shapes: The clusters appear to be more elongated and less compact compared to the LBP features. This could indicate that while PCA helps in reducing dimensionality and capturing variance, it might not capture some of the finer details that LBP features do.

3. Comparison with LBP: Comparing the two t-SNE plots, the LBP features seem to form more compact and well-defined clusters, whereas the PCA features show clusters that are more elongated and less distinct.


Both LBP and PCA features provide reasonable clustering. However, the LBP features might be slightly better at capturing the nuances of the data, leading to more compact and distinct clusters.

"""Evaluating the quality of clusters produced by a clustering algorithm is a crucial step in any data analysis task. While visual methods like t-SNE plots provide a qualitative assessment, quantitative metrics offer a more objective evaluation. Two widely-used clustering validation indices are the Davies-Bouldin Index and the Calinski-Harabasz Index. These indices help in understanding the compactness and separation of clusters, providing insights into the clustering performance.

**Davies-Bouldin Index**
The Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) is defined as the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster that is most similar to it. Lower values of the DB Index indicate better clustering performance, with well-separated and compact clusters.

**Calinski-Harabasz Index:**
The Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH Index) measures the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion and within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better clustering.

**Davies-Bouldin Index Interpretation:**

In this case, the PCA features have a lower DBI compared to the LBP features, suggesting that the clustering with PCA features is slightly better according to this metric.

**Calinski-Harabasz Index Interpretation:**

The PCA features have a significantly higher CHI compared to the LBP features, suggesting that the clustering with PCA features is better according to this metric as well.

**Insight: PCA Features Perform Better**

"""**Silhouette Score Interpretation:**

The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better-defined clusters.
The negative score for LBP features suggests that the clusters are poorly defined, with many points potentially being assigned to incorrect clusters.
The score for PCA features is better, indicating moderately well-defined clusters, although still not ideal.


**Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) Interpretation:**

Lower values of the Davies-Bouldin Index indicate better clustering.
The high DBI for LBP features indicates poor clustering quality.
The DBI for PCA features is lower but still not as good as the K-Means clustering results.

**Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) Interpretation:**

Higher values of the Calinski-Harabasz Index indicate better clustering.
The CHI for both LBP and PCA features is significantly lower than the K-Means results, suggesting poorer clustering quality with DBSCAN for this dataset.
Insights and Recommendations
DBSCAN Performance:

The DBSCAN algorithm did not perform well on the LBP features, as indicated by the negative silhouette score and high DBI.
While the PCA features performed better with DBSCAN compared to LBP features, the clustering quality is still not as good as that achieved with K-Means.

**Comparison with K-Means:**

K-Means clustering appears to be more suitable for this dataset, particularly when using PCA-transformed features.
The PCA features consistently perform better across different metrics, suggesting that dimensionality reduction helps improve clustering quality.

### ANN

Based on the analysis and the clustering validation metrics, clusters from PCA features have demonstrated better performance.
In this context, we aim to leverage the ANN to classify images into distinct categories based on the features extracted from PCA.

The following snippet code outlines the process of building, training, and evaluating an ANN for the task of classifying images into four clusters. These clusters are derived from applying K-Means clustering on PCA-transformed features of the original Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features.

We start by defining a simple ANN architecture. In particular it consists of three dense (fully connected) layers:
1. The first layer has 128 neurons with ReLU activation and a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
2. The second layer has 64 neurons with ReLU activation and a dropout rate of 0.5.
3. The output layer has 4 neurons with softmax activation, corresponding to the four clusters.

We then compile the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification and the evaluation metric chosen is accuracy.

After just 10 epochs the model reports an accuracy of 95% on the test set. As amazing as this is, it's crucial to validate the model thoroughly to ensure its robustness and generalizability.

1. **Confusion Matrix:** generating a confusion matrix to understand the model's performance across different classes.

2. **Classification Report:** generating a classification report to obtain precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

3. **Cross-Validation:** using k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

4. **Learning Curves:** plotting the accuracy and loss learning curves for both training and validation sets to observe the model's performance over epochs.

To evaluate a model's performance it's essential to validate the model on a separate test set to understand how well it generalizes to new, unseen data.

In classification tasks, one common evaluation method is to use a confusion matrix, which provides a detailed breakdown of the model's prediction results by showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class.

**Confusion Matrix Interpretation:**

The confusion matrix shows that the model performs exceptionally well on the test set. Most classes have very few misclassifications, with the majority of the predicted labels matching the true labels. For instance, Class 0 has a few misclassifications (8 samples predicted as other classes), but Classes 1, 2, and 3 have very high accuracy, with almost no misclassifications.

1. Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. High precision indicates a low false positive rate.
2. Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in the actual class. High recall indicates a low false negative rate.
3. F1-Score: The weighted average of precision and recall. It takes both false positives and false negatives into account and is especially useful when class distribution is imbalanced.
4. Support: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the dataset.

**Classification Report Interpretation:**

All classes have precision, recall, and F1-scores close to or equal to 1.00.
For what concerns support, the number of samples for each class is relatively balanced, with each class having a significant number of samples.

One popular method is K-Fold Cross-Validation, which involves partitioning the dataset into k subsets (folds) and iteratively training and validating the model on different combinations of these folds. This approach helps ensure that the model's performance is not overfitting or dependent on any particular train-test split, providing a more reliable estimate of its accuracy.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of K-Fold Cross-Validation for evaluating an ANN model. A K-Fold cross-validator is created with 5 splits, shuffling the data before splitting, and a fixed random state for reproducibility. For each fold, the data is split into training and validation sets based on the indices provided by the K-Fold cross-validator.

The architecture consists of three dense layers with ReLU activations, interspersed with dropout layers to prevent overfitting, and a final softmax layer for multi-class classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.

**Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores Interpretation:**

2. **Regularization**: considering adding or increasing regularization techniques, such as dropout, L2 regularization, or data augmentation, to ensure the model does not overfit.

In the next snippet code we are going to train a regularized ANN model with an increased number of epochs (30 instead of 10) and evaluate its performance through accuracy and loss plots.

2. Model 3: the accuracy curve shows a steady increase, reaching close to 0.99. The validation accuracy also remains high and stable, indicating strong generalization with the help of L2 regularization.

1. Training Accuracy and Loss: Model 1 shows a steady increase in training accuracy and a corresponding decrease in training loss over the 10 epochs. The training loss starts around 0.08 and decreases to approximately 0.06, indicating that the model is learning well.
2. Validation Accuracy and Loss: the validation accuracy remains higher than the training accuracy, suggesting that the model generalizes well to the validation data. The validation loss decreases consistently, mirroring the training loss.

Model 3 Learning Curves
1. Training Accuracy and Loss: Model 3 has a higher initial training loss of about 1.2, which decreases steadily over 30 epochs, indicating that the model is learning and fitting the training data well. However, the final training loss is higher compared to Model 1 due to the L2 regularization.
2. Validation Accuracy and Loss: the validation accuracy remains consistently high, around 0.99, showing good generalization. The validation loss, although initially higher, decreases significantly, indicating that the regularization is helping in preventing overfitting.

To conclude, Model 1 shows strong performance on the training set, but the lack of regularization might pose risks of overfitting with more epochs. Model 3, with L2 regularization, shows slightly better generalization on the validation set despite a higher training loss. This regularization helps in controlling overfitting and maintaining high validation accuracy over a longer training period.

The model seems to be performing exceptionally well without signs of overfitting. The learning curves, combined with the previously discussed validation metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curves, classification report, and cross-validation accuracy scores), suggest that the model is robust and generalizes well.

"""### Autoencoders

**Autoencoders** are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning, primarily to learn efficient codings of input data. The network is trained to encode the input into a lower-dimensional latent space representation and then decode this representation back to the original input. The main components of an autoencoder are:

1. Encoder: This part of the network compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation. It consists of several layers that reduce the input dimensions to the latent space dimensions.

2. Latent Space: This is the compressed representation of the input data. It captures the most important features of the input while discarding noise and redundancy.

3. Decoder: This part of the network reconstructs the input data from the latent space representation. It consists of layers that expand the latent space dimensions back to the original input dimensions.

The goal of training an autoencoder is to minimize the reconstruction error, which is the difference between the original input and the reconstructed input.

We are going to start by uploading the PCA enriched features and setting up the input and encoding dimensions.

1. Input Dimension: represents the number of features in our data. After applying PCA, our data has fewer dimensions than the original dataset. Input dimension has to match the number of PCA components we have used.
2. Encoding Dimension: This is the reduced dimension where the autoencoder learns the compressed representation. We are going to choose a smaller number to compress the input data.

**Cluster Formation:**

* The clusters are visible but have significant overlap, particularly in the regions where the yellow, blue, and green clusters intersect. This indicates that the clusters are not well-separated in the latent space learned by the autoencoder.

"""Let’s consider a few more advanced techniques and refinements that could potentially improve the clustering performance.

### VAE

**Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** are a type of generative model and an extension of standard autoencoders. They introduce a probabilistic approach to the encoding-decoding process, allowing them to generate new data samples similar to the input data.

The main components and differences from standard autoencoders are:

 1. **Encoder:** In VAEs, the encoder maps the input data to a distribution over the latent space, typically represented by the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution. This allows the latent variables to follow a continuous, smooth distribution.

2. **Latent Space:** Instead of a single point, the latent space in VAEs consists of a distribution. During training, latent variables are sampled from this distribution using the reparameterization trick, which allows gradients to be backpropagated through the stochastic sampling process.

3. **Decoder:** The decoder reconstructs the input data from the sampled latent variables. By decoding samples from the latent distribution, VAEs can generate new, similar data points.

In the following code, we implement a VAE to learn a meaningful, low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data.
We start by creating the VAE model with an encoder, decoder, and a custom loss function combining reconstruction loss and KL divergence. We then train the VAE on the dataset to learn the latent representations. Moreover, we use the trained encoder to obtain the latent representations (encoded features) of the train and test data.

After training the VAE, we use the encoded representations as features for clustering with KMeans. The combination of VAE and KMeans leverages the strengths of both models: VAE's ability to learn compact, informative latent spaces and KMeans' simplicity and effectiveness in partitioning data into clusters.

To evaluate the clustering performance, we use several metrics, including the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.

The improved silhouette scores with the VAE and KMeans combination and the good results from the DB and CH Indexes indicate that the clustering performance has significantly improved. The scores are now more reasonable, suggesting that the VAE has learned a meaningful representation of the data.

The silhouette scores for both the train and test data are around 0.45. These scores indicate that the clusters are moderately well-formed and somewhat well-separated. A silhouette score closer to 1 indicates that the clusters are well-defined and distinct, while a score closer to -1 indicates that the clusters overlap significantly. Scores around 0.45 suggest that the clusters are reasonably well-defined but not perfectly separated.

The Davies-Bouldin Index measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster most similar to it. Lower values indicate better clustering quality. The values around 0.70 for both train and test data suggest that the clusters are reasonably well-separated. The similarity between the train and test values indicates that the clustering model generalizes well to unseen data.

The Calinski-Harabasz Index assesses the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters. The train data index is significantly higher than the test data index, which suggests that the clustering is better-defined on the training data.

* The steady increase in training accuracy indicates that the model is learning and improving its performance on the training data.
* The validation accuracy, while generally higher than the training accuracy, fluctuates, indicating some variance in model performance on unseen data. This fluctuation could be due to the complexity of the data or variability in the validation set.

"""**Analysis of VAE-based Clustering and ANN Classification**

You've performed an extensive evaluation and comparison between the VAE-based latent space clustering and the traditional PCA-based clustering. Let's break down the results and their implications.

**t-SNE Visualization**: The t-SNE visualization shows a well-separated cluster structure in the VAE latent space, indicating that the VAE has effectively captured meaningful features from the data.

Cluster Evaluation Metrics

**Silhouette Score:**

VAE + KMeans: Train: 0.5409, Test: 0.5364
PCA + KMeans: Train: 0.4502, Test: 0.4477

The higher silhouette score for VAE + KMeans indicates better-defined and more compact clusters compared to PCA + KMeans.

**Davies-Bouldin Index:**

VAE + KMeans: Train: 0.5749, Test: 0.5609
PCA + KMeans: Train: 0.7066, Test: 0.6931

The lower Davies-Bouldin index for VAE + KMeans suggests better separation between clusters.

**Calinski-Harabasz Index:**

VAE + KMeans: Train: 12270.27, Test: 3520.23
PCA + KMeans: Train: 8453.09, Test: 2343.94

The higher Calinski-Harabasz index for VAE + KMeans indicates better-defined clusters.

**ANN Classification Performance**

Test Accuracy (ANN on VAE latent space): 0.9247
This high test accuracy indicates that the latent features learned by the VAE are effective for classification tasks.

**Interpretation and Recommendations**
1. Effectiveness of VAE: The VAE has clearly captured meaningful and discriminative features in its latent space, as evidenced by the higher clustering evaluation scores and the high ANN classification accuracy.

2. Comparison with PCA: The VAE outperforms PCA in clustering tasks, as shown by the silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz indices. This suggests that the VAE is better at capturing complex structures in the data.

3. Model Robustness: Both the VAE-based clustering and ANN classification models show high performance and robustness. The consistent performance across training and test sets indicates good generalization.

The cross-validation results indicate consistent clustering performance across different splits of the data, which is a good sign of the robustness and reliability of your model. The average silhouette scores for both train and test sets are around 0.53, suggesting that the VAE + KMeans approach is working reasonably well for your data.
